We are investors in the future of fast food.

Huel is a nutritionally complete powdered food that contains all the protein, carbs, fats, vitamins and minerals your body needs.

We sit on the board of the company and provide strategic consultancy to the founder with a vision to become the global number one 'complete foodâ€™ brand. Our consultancy ranges from marketing strategy, NPD, commercial strategy, global development as the business rapidly moves into new territories.

Huel has grown phenomenally quickly in its first 12 months due to a ground breaking product and focus on social media marketing to earn brand love and revenue simultaneously. The brand ambassadors, Huelers, are a group of people who are already committed to the brand and are involved in all aspects of building the business with constant communication between the brand and consumer to always improve the Huel products. In this way Huel acts more like an ever evolving tech company than a traditional food business. Huel 2.0 was launched in August 2016, with Huel 2.1 only a few months away.

As the business grows so will our role to fuel the development of the brand, business and Huelers community.
