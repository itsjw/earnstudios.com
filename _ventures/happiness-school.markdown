intro: Whether it’s in the work place or elsewhere in our lives, the benefits of happiness
  are obvious. Happy people earn more and live longer, because they’re more productive
  - and thus – more fulfilled.

Well-being at work often gets overlooked – but why? And at what cost? 

The UK government estimates that sickness absence, labour turnover, and “presenteeism” – what they call zombie workers who are technically there in body, but otherwise contributing nothing to the workplace – costs upwards of £26 billion a year. But with a little bit more positive energy pumped into things, that loss could turn into a far greater profit than money can buy: a true sense of purpose and satisfaction.

So it’s no surprise that Positive Psychology 101 has become one of the most popular courses at Harvard Business School. Finally – people are realising that by fostering good vibes – in ourselves, in our relationships, in our co-workers and staff – we can intentionally improve the quality of our lives tenfold and help our businesses succeed and our careers thrive. 

Not all of us are naturally sunny. So how do we get happy?

Here’s how. 

Introducing...  The EARN Happiness School.

The EARN Happiness School is a series of annual workshops hosted by EARN on the gloomiest day of your year (Blue Monday) where we focus on creating our happiness goals for the year and increasing our individual happiness, wellbeing and performance. We combine education with experience – making the most of what we’ve got and boost productivity.
 
The EARN Happiness School programme gives participants the time to reflect and the opportunity to learn together and helps to inspire each attendee to set his own annual happiness goals. 

Each workshop is led by instructor Bridget Grenville-Cleave, the author of Positive Psychology: A Practical Guide. Bridget is passionate about wellbeing and closely identifies with the values at the core of EARN’s manifesto and services, specialising in the well-being of organisations and professionals.
 
EARN is leading the way in this new approach to improving progress, productivity, and fulfilment in every part of our lives.
