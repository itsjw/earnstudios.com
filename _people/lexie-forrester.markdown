Lexie studied fashion marketing and branding at university but it was when she was writing her dissertation she realised her interests and inspirations lay a little broader than this. Initially inspired by the conference MIDEM she looked to explore how brands could use the mediums of music to increase their equity and engage emotionally.  At EARN she helps bring imagination and energy to the team.
