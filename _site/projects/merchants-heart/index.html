		Merchant’s Heart was launched into 10 beta bars in London during December 2015 – just six months after our first conversation about the project. 
During the Annual Global Suntory Research and Development Conference in Japan, Merchant’s Heart was voted as the most popular new product development of the year.  We credit its success to the collaborative approach taken in developing this product and the multidisciplinary team’s vision for how to bring it to market.
