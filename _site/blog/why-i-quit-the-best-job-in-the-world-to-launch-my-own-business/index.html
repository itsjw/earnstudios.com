But with that said, I think it’s important for you to know a bit of my background before I get into the meat of this blog.</h3>
<p>I left Monster Energy as VP of Marketing, a position I had secured after my success as the Head of Marketing for Red Bull, to launch my own entrepreneurial creative agency, EARN. Did I leave Monster because I was unhappy? Not at all. I actually appreciated the freedom Monster gave me to start with a blank piece of paper, build a marketing team from scratch, develop processes and create a culture from nothing. But after five years at Monster, I just felt it was time for me to move on and to open up space for my amazing team to progress.</p>
<p>Now, I’m not trying to make it sound like it was a zen process for me because it wasn’t. I still sometimes reflect and think: “Am I mad in making this choice?” But then when I look back at my career, it’s apparent that I’m the kind of person that’s about building things. And after my runs at Red Bull and Monster, I felt it was time to start building again, but this time for myself. It was time for me to build my own team, my own culture and my own processes that are centred on my own values. I wanted to take the innovative model of marketing we’d developed at Monster and Red Bull and share it with other brands. You can read more about that model in <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Brand-Love-Build-Worth-Talking-ebook/dp/B00VBPBU1G">Brand Love</a>, a book I co-authored with Graham Brown and Paul O’Shannessey.</p>
<p>Now that we’ve got my background (and my shameless book plug) out of the way, let’s dive into the topic at hand: Why did I quit the best job in the world to launch my own business?</p>
<p>I didn’t leave Monster because I wanted to escape corporate life. I had a great boss, but I wanted to be in control. I wanted to be my own boss and I wanted to be able to make decisions that reflected my values, like spending more time with my family.</p>
<p>When the time came to leave Monster, I tried to leave quietly, but contrary to my plans my team decided to surprise me by taking me out for dinner. I can remember sitting at the dinner being so overwhelmed by the thought that I was leaving. It was such an intense moment. It wasn’t that I was having any fear; it was just the enormity of what I was attempting to accomplish. I was on a new road where I absolutely had no real experience of building my own business or running an agency.</p>
<p>There was also an element of leaving something behind. At Red Bull and Monster, I was very fortunate to attend and produce some amazing events with amazing people like Formula 1 or the Red Bull Air Race. It was an incredibly rewarding and exciting time. However, I was also beginning to feel that I had grown past that period of my life. I was at Red Bull and Monster in my 20’s and early 30’s, and that was a good 10 years of my life. Now, I’d much rather have more simple experiences and more time with my children, wife and extended family and friends because the downside of corporate life is obviously it takes so much of your time away. So I didn’t really see leaving as giving up. I saw it as the right step into an exciting new phase of my life.</p>
<p>After a few days of leaving Monster, once I started to actually talk about being the founder of EARN and was able to land a few client meetings, it was exhilarating. It was so exciting. I felt free - like the whole world was an opportunity. I felt creative; like I did in those early years of starting each job.</p>
<p>I’m actually writing this blog from an office I built in my garden. EARN has an office in London for the team where we work together and work with clients, but when I don’t need to go into town, I can just walk across the garden and work from here. And that’s not to say I have a simple easy life now. I would say that I work just as hard and probably longer hours than I did at Monster. And even when I’m with my family, I’m thinking about the business, but by being in control, it’s a totally different kind of energy. I now have the option to say no to things that don’t match up with the kind of life that I’m building for my family or for the wider team at EARN. At EARN we ultimately do work that we’re really proud of. We create strategy and ideas that get the world talking about our clients’ brands and products. Having such an ambitious daily goal means I’ve managed to create a job I can see myself doing for the rest of my life, which I’m very grateful for.

<p>My advice to those who are thinking about taking this kind of leap of faith is to remember that there’s nothing to stop anyone from building a business these days with very little resources. I think that if you do have the energy to start your own enterprise, you can dream big, but just start small. At EARN, we often say: “It’s better to dream big, and start small, and actually do 1% of the journey than nothing at all.” If your dream is to start an agency, just aim to do that 1%, and then see where that takes you and what conversations that brings, and meet as many people as you can, and learn from as many people as you can because that’s ultimately the greatest currency that you can get.</p>
<p>Now that you’ve heard from me, I’d like to hear from you. Are you in a dream job, but considering starting your own business? What do you think of my decision to leave Monster and launch EARN?</p>
