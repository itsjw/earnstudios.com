<p>This year’s event was the biggest yet - with over fifty attendees. Either word has spread, or people feel that now more than ever an extra dose of happiness is required and frankly, who are we to disagree?</p>
<p>EARN Happiness School (EHS) began as an internal project for EARN employees with the mission to ‘make work our happy place’.</p>
<p>Fuelled by the belief that a happier team would equate to a better performing, more creative and productive team – which in turn gives us happier clients.</p>
<p><img src="/uploads/earn-happiness-school-one.jpg" alt="earn-happiness-school-one.jpg" /></p>
<p>We’re certainly not professing to uncover the definitive answer for how to be happy, but we do believe that being mindful of happiness and understanding more about it will lead to a more positive and fulfilling existence.</p>
<p>Far better than us to try to explain the science behind happiness, we have worked with leading positive psychologist <a href="https://twitter.com/bridgetgc">Bridget Grenville-Cleave</a> to co-create the EARN Happiness School and help develop the accompanying personal happiness tracker app – <a href="http://howsyourday.today/">How’s Your Day?</a>.</p>
<p>Bridget is a firm believer that an individual can control their own happiness: “Research has shown that 60 percent of happiness is determined by our genetics and environment, meaning the remaining 40 percent is up to us. Through improved self-awareness and happiness training, people can become more positive in their outlook and their lives”.</p>
<p>Furthermore, research proves that there is an on-going list of benefits related to happiness that are more than just about ‘feeling good.’ For instance happiness is linked to increased creativity, higher performance, greater resilience, a stronger immune system and even a greater life expectancy.</p>
<p>In addition to inspiring and insightful learnings from Bridget, this year we welcomed <a href="https://twitter.com/doctob">Dr Tim O’Brien</a> to explore our chosen topic; ‘Is happiness a key factor in high performing teams?’</p>
<p>He took us on a philosophical journey to share his view that happiness is a perception, that perception is not reality, and that in fact perception is your filter to reality. It’s a lot to get your head around, but actually when you spend the time considering this philosophy and applying it to your own life, you too start nodding in agreement.</p>
<p>Fundamental to high performing teams is what Tim refers to as a person’s  ‘inner story’ – that is to say what it truly means to be in a team and what each person’s attributes add to create the perfect mix.</p>
<p>Being appreciative of each team member’s inner story is also key. More so acting on everyone’s individual values so they become real behaviours and not just characteristics that are used to describe the overall team.</p>
<p>Additionally, genuinely understanding the needs within a team is paramount, from the common needs shared amongst everyone to the distinct needs of the individuals. Through this greater understanding and knowledge, teams can build trust and respect - key factors affecting performance. It’s a big topic, and one that is best explained in Tim’s new book ‘<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Inner-Story-Understand-Change-world/dp/1518820476/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1453907655&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=inner\+story">Inner Story</a>’</p>
<p><img src="/uploads/earn-happiness-school-two.jpg" alt="earn-happiness-school-two.jpg" /></p>
<p>So to answer the original question, ‘Is happiness a key factor in high performing teams?’ though for now it may be hard to scientifically prove that it is, learning from Tim’s experiences and examples, it unquestionably offers a positive improvement to both individuals and teams as a whole and that’s of great value to any business.</p>
