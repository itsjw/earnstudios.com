Happiness at work is not rocket science; the research findings on what makes people happy at work are, for the most part, surprisingly ordinary. Having good work recognised, getting positive feedback and feeling respected all make a difference to how people feel about their work, so you could say that being a great boss is simple (although not necessarily easy) to do. 

But why should you care if your staff are happy at work or not? Well, there is growing evidence from the field of Positive Psychology that aside from just feeling good, being happy at work has significant business benefits and since we are always looking for new ways to have the edge over our competitors and be more successful organisations, could a focus on happiness be what you’ve been waiting for?

**1. Higher creativity**

It’s a bit of a myth that high pressure, negativity and fear in the workplace give rise to high achievement, particularly in roles which require creativity. In fact, research by Professor Theresa Amabile and colleagues at Harvard Business School (1)  suggests that people are more likely to come up with creative ideas if they’re in a good mood. What’s more, there is a carry-over effect meaning that being in a good mood today also contributes to your creativity and original thinking tomorrow. 
Studies carried out by Positive Psychology expert, Barbara Fredrickson, suggest that positive emotions do more than just make us feel good, they also enable us to function better. It seems that people who feel good also think more creatively. She concluded that >“…when people feel good, their thinking becomes more creative, integrative, flexible and open to information”. (2)

So if your organisation could benefit from more creative, original or innovative thinking and ideas, it makes good business sense to find ways to enhance the level of happiness amongst your employees.

**2. Better relationships**

Relationships and happiness are interconnected – when we feel happy we find it easier to reach out and make connections with others and having people around us who we like, trust and can rely on boosts our well-being (3)  and our intrinsic motivation (4). In fact, relationships are so important to us that they feature in many different models of human well-being (5). 

Being happier at work also leads to better relationships and even if you are more of an introvert than a team player at work, there are very few roles which couldn’t be enhanced by stronger connections with others. Even relatively solitary jobs like writing, researching or data analysis benefit from the input of other people at some stage in the process. Having a pool of supportive friends, colleagues and acquaintances to call on for advice, help or ideas, as well as the personal skills and abilities to manage those relationships effectively are essential. There is evidence from Positive Psychology that feeling happy contributes to better relationships as well as vice versa (6)  and that workplace friendships lead to greater engagement (7). 

**3. Greater Engagement**

Engagement has become a real buzzword around organisations in the past decade. Being ‘engaged’ at work generally means that you are fully absorbed by and enthusiastic about what you do, and are happy to go the extra mile for your employer. Employee engagement has a huge range of business benefits: amongst other things it’s linked to reduced absenteeism, higher retention, greater effort and productivity, increased sales, turnover and profitability and enhanced customer satisfaction (8). 

Unsurprisingly, business leaders the world over want to know the secret of increasing levels of employee engagement. Given the Positive Psychology evidence that happiness and engagement are linked, psychologists Martin Stairs and Martin Galpin suggest that boosting happiness at work is key. So, if you want your staff to be more engaged, focus on their happiness!

**4. Better problem-solving**

Experiencing positive emotions (such as delight, interest and contentment) develops our awareness and capacity to think and behave in different ways, which Professor Barbara Fredrickson calls the ‘broaden and build’ effect. In other words, feeling positive on a frequent basis broadens our outlook and over time builds enduring mental, physical, social and intellectual resources, including our ability to solve problems (9).  So, high-quality problem-solving isn’t just dependent on our level of experience and our ability to engage in left-brain, analytical thinking. It relies on us feeling good too.

**5. Better decision-making**

Our work lives and business outcomes are enhanced when we make good decisions. As with problem-solving, the quality of our decision-making depends to a great extent on our expertise in a given field, our knowledge and our experience. But interestingly, research in the domains of psychology and neuroscience have revealed that positive emotions also influence the decision-making process. What we now know is that our happiness is not peripheral or inconsequential, it actually plays an important, integral role in shaping how we think, plan and make decisions (10). 

As we mentioned above, happiness at work isn’t only about fair terms and conditions, although they have a part to play. With the amount of knowledge and experience around now in the field of Positive Psychology, and inspirational business initiatives like the EARN Happiness School, there is an enormous amount that you can do to influence the level of happiness in your organisation and reap the combined individual and business benefits. If you care about yourself, your business and your staff, surely it’s a no-brainer?
