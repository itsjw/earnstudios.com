### How to build a brand worth talking about

In a world where the average customer grows up seeing 170,000 marketing messages by their 17th birthday; where 86% of people admit to sharing social media content in the bathroom; where less than 1% of young people trust advertising; customers only talk about the brands they LOVE. And, if customers aren't talking about your brand, you might as well not exist. 

* There are 18,000,000 photos on Instagram tagged #starbucks. Not one is paid for by Starbucks. 
* When Chinese mobile brand Xiaomi launched their new tablet, stock sold out in 2.7 seconds 
* Monster Energy drinks has become the most successful energy drinks brand in the US, without a single dollar spent on advertising 
* LEGO continues to defy the expectations of critics and analysts, selling billions of dollars of analog toys in the digital age. 

### All these stories are made possible by Brand Love

Fans don't just "like" these brands, they love them. And the good news is that it's neither expensive nor exclusive to cool cutting-edge brands. Brand Love is achievable for all brands. Whether you're an airline or selling energy drinks, Brand Love is an approach to building a brand worth talking about.


We helped Castrol become the most shared sponsor of the 2014 FIFA World Cup (source Unruly) - our Castrol Footkhana film grossed 1 million shares and was the most shared film on planet Earth in its  opening week. It’s not just about social media shares either; our approach works in generating hard sales. We collaborated with three of the biggest YouTube superstars to create Limited Edition SIMs that helped EE, the UK’s largest mobile operator, acquire 25,000 new customers overnight. Total sum spent on paid media advertising for both results? = $0.00.

We’re not anti-advertising or paid media, we just believe these investments should come much later on a CMOs’ list to drive share and sales. We recognise that delivering earned impressions are harder to achieve, especially when organic reach through popular social networks is in such fast decline. But why not build your own brand platform for your fans? That’s what we did at Red Bull because when you’re in full control of your ecosystem, no matter how large or small, it’s easier to move consumers from like to love and from customer to ambassador. Red Bull global brand properties such as the Red Bull Air Race, Red Bull Music Academy or Red Bull Racing were far more efficient than traditional sponsorship or advertising. Just type in ‘Red Bull’ to Google and you’ll see the vast earned media this approach produces. As their CEO, Dietrich Mateschitz said, “In literal financial terms, our sports teams are not yet profitable, but in value terms, they are. The total editorial media value plus the media assets created around the teams are superior to pure advertising expenditures”. 

Of course not all marketers want to change. There will always be marketers who outsource their work to the same agency because ‘they’ll never get fired for buying media or making a TV ad’. As they say, you can take a horse to water but you can’t make it drink. That’s why we spend our time backing the right horses, the ones that are already thirsty. These are the brave ones that dare to dream big.
