It’s almost redundant to say the digital landscape has changed drastically in the last decade, but why hasn’t the marketer’s toolkit evolved with it? They say you can’t use old tools for today’s job and be in business tomorrow and we agree. 

EARN Founder Jamal Benmiloud (former Head of Marketing for Red Bull and VP of Marketing at Monster Energy) and Stephen Taylor (former CMO of Samsung and Global Brand Director of Proctor and Gamble) have engaged in a series of frank, unscripted chats that address this and other key marketing challenges that the industry is currently facing. 

**Issue number one: the marketer’s toolkit.** 
If marketers want more effective means of getting their message in front of their target audiences and enticing these audiences to engage with their content and brands, marketers may need to upgrade their toolkits.

**What is the marketer’s toolkit?**

**Stephen Taylor:** The marketer’s toolkit is sort of simple, but we do our best to overcomplicate it. First, you start with the “who”. Who are you targeting with the product or proposition you’ve got? You need to be super-clear on who they are and more importantly, who they are not. What types of media are they interacting with? Which are the ones they’re not? 

The second piece is the “what”. Some people call the “what” the concept or the value proposition. It’s the products, services and brand values you’re offering the consumer that make you distinct and differentiated and stand out from the rest. It’s linked back to the people you’ve identified as your “who”; the prime people you’re targeting.

Then there is the “how.” You probably need to be more robust about what your business model is. Is there a digital disruption or other disruption that could influence it? This needs to be thoroughly thought through, more so than in the past. 

The last bit, which I think is the most complicated for people today is how you get your message to your “who.” What is your method for getting your message to the consumers that’s going to add all of these elements together giving your target audience the right message about who you are, what you stand for and what you’ve got to offer that is different. I think this is the element that’s seen the most dramatic change. It’s the one that needs aggressive re-examination. 

**What does the future marketer’s toolkit look like?** 

**Jamal Benmiloud:** Twenty years ago, the “how” was connecting with audiences through television, radio and print ads. Now, people just aren’t talking about advertisements in the office or at school. It just doesn’t work in the same way. Now it’s about creating platforms or creating experiences for the same effect. 

There are brands that have worked out that digital for them is about partnering. It’s thinking: “Right, what can we invent together and work together to do?” which is way more powerful an idea than just taking your offline business and plastering it in the online world. The brands of the future are the ones that understand that. Before, it was all about buying, whereas in the future it’s about partnering. In essence your digital product experience IS your brand. 

**What obstacle do you think marketers need to prepare for in the nearby future?**

**Jamal Benmiloud:** Ad blocking. All it takes is for people to block marketing. You look at Brazil and there are certain cities, like São Paulo, that have decided: no more OOH advertising. There is something about the rise of ad blocking that’s asking the marketing industry what are we doing to make sure we’re actually adding value to people’s lives, and that’s driving us to create welcoming experiences that people want to engage with rather than block. 

**Stephen Taylor:** I think that’s going to be absolutely crucial. I think one of the irritations and the downsides of marketing via mobile device and digital is how intrusive it is; how many pop-ups you get that you don’t want. I’ve suddenly got all of these notifications that say my Moshi Monster needs feeding and I didn’t even know I had a Moshi Monster. All that stuff will be the downfall. 

Now that you’ve read what Jamal and Stephen had to say, we’d love to hear your thoughts. Do you think the marketer’s toolkit is overdue for an upgrade or do you think it’s timeless? Get in touch and let us know.
