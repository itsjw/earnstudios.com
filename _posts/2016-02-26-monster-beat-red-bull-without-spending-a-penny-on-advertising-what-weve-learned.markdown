#### Monster Energy drinks is… well… a monster, at least when it comes to marketing. Monster is a multi-billion dollar brand that, at times, has been more profitable per employee than Apple. Monster has grown its market share from nothing to a market lead of 36% of the US market, surpassing its rival, big-spender Red Bull and they did it without investing a penny in advertising. So, how did David manage to beat Goliath against all the odds?

Well, [traditional Ogilvy-era marketing](/do-companies-even-need-creative-agencies-in-the-connection-economy/) focuses on resource intensive launches e.g. media buying, expensive campaigns and in-store promotions, which produce a tangible but very short-lived spike in sales and brand awareness. By contrast, Monster operates under a “waste not, want not” credo, investing all of its resources into cultivating Brand Love by converting their target market into fans who then go on to influence and recruit mainstream customers. 

Monster’s success lies in their ability to get the right people on board and to leverage those people’s own networks to create influence within the markets they target. In other words Monster found their ecosystem. 

Ecosystems are natural, authentic networks based on real-world scenes. Each ecosystem has its own protocol, from the language used to the clothes worn. These networks possess a code often hidden to the outsider that reinforces social dynamics like who’s “in”, who’s “out” and who the key influencers are. Wherever your people already have networks is where you need to start building your brand. 

The Monster ecosystem lives within the Moto Cross, BMX and punk rock scenes. They realised this early on and made a concerted effort to curate a team of people who dwelled within these ecosystems. A pierced, tattooed chap wearing leather boots, a tattered Misfits vest and a baseball cap would stick out like a sore thumb at Pepsi, but for Monster he could be a pivotal brand touchpoint for fans.

“At Monster, all of our guys walk the walk in action sports, punk rock music, partying, hangin’ with the girls and living life on the edge. Monster is way more than an energy drink. Led by our athletes, musicians, employees, distributors and fans, Monster is a lifestyle in a can!” — from the Monster Energy official Facebook page 

It’s what EARN Founder and CCO, Jamal Benmiloud, formerly leading the marketing teams at both Red Bull and Monster, calls “story being” rather than “storytelling”. It’s building the brand from the inside, starting with its own people, growing an authentic brand.  

Brand Love isn’t reserved for hip, youth-oriented brands like Monster and Apple. It’s even possible if you’re operating in a less exciting, more restrictive sector like an airline. And you don’t need expensive campaigns or extensive redesigns to develop it. As a matter of fact, these traditional marketing techniques often fall apart after customers experience brands. If you want to cultivate Brand Love you have to start with your people. Who are your fans? Where is their ecosystem? Enlist a beachhead of employees and fans who love your idea, actively promote your brand and want a meaningful relationship with your company and then meet them where they live.
