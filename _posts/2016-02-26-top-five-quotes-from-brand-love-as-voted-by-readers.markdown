### We checked Amazon to find out the quotes that readers loved most from our Brand Love book. Here are the ‘top five’ principles, according to you:

1. What matters is not what you make for your customers, but what you mean to them. 

1. If customers like you, be afraid. If customers like you, you might as well be invisible. People only recommend the brands they love. 

1. Make a commitment to stop going after quantity and awareness and start going after quality and attention. 

1. Find the ecosystem where your brand can grow. Find your tribe, your home, the place where you belong. Grow your brand there. Respect the dynamics and relationships and the ecosystem will look after you long-term. 

1. Today, in ‘The Connection Economy’, everyone becomes a marketer by default. We’re not just talking about your customers. Think about how every single person in your business has become a marketer too. They all have their own networks; they all talk about your brand on a daily basis. Your marketing team, your call centre staff, your HR people, your CEO and your retail frontline – everyone is connected to everyone else.
