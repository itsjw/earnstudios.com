At EARN, we believe that there are three key drivers of brand love: **people, culture and metrics**. 

It’s nice if you can get it right but it’s not always integral to business success. However, taking on the learnings from our experience at Red Bull and Monster Energy, we know that your people **ARE** your most powerful marketing platform. It was the people and the culture of these organisations that made them the successes you see today. If you start to treat marketing as a mind-set, not a department, then you will unlock something very powerful within your organisation.

And once you’ve got the people and culture bit right, you can start to turn your attention to metrics. How are you evaluating success for your business? Time and time again, we talk to brands to try to get them to reassess the way they are viewing reporting and measurement. This has a fundamental effect on the way your business operates and performs.

Our belief is that, more often than not, brands should be investing their time and attention in establishing more quality over quantity metrics (NPS, engagement and recommendation) because if you get these right then the quantity metrics and sales will come... and will be much more sustainable in the long-term. If you focus first and foremost on sales and performance, then you will only allow your teams to be thinking with a very short-termist view.

So, that’s our humble view but we’d love to hear your thoughts… is there anything you would add or change? What has your experience been around the importance of people, culture and marketing metrics?
