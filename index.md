  In a world where the average customer grows up seeing 170,000 marketing messages by their 17th birthday; where 86% of people admit to sharing social media content in the bathroom; where 20% of smartphone users have installed adblocking browsers because of their loathing of advertising; customers only talk about the brands they LOVE. And, if customers aren’t talking about your brand, you might as well not exist.
