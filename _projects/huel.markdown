Huel is a nutritionally complete powdered food ​that contains all the proteins, carbs, and fats you need, plus at least 100% of the European Union's "Daily Recommended Amounts" of all 26 essential vitamins and minerals​. So you know you won’t be deficient in any essential nutrients. Huel is 100% vegan (better for the environment and animals), super convenient, requires minimal packaging and has a shelf-life of 12 months (so zero food waste).

Our founder, Jamal Benmiloud, sits on the board of the company and provides strategic consultancy to help them in their mission to become the global number one ‘complete food’ business.

Huel has grown phenomenally quickly in its first two years due to ground-breaking products, customer service and a focus on [social media marketing](https://www.instagram.com/huel/).
