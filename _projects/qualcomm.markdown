brief-text: Qualcomm asked us for help demonstrating the groundbreaking power of their
  technology. So, what did we do? We launched the first ever drone race at Wembley
  Stadium.
solution-text: "Working together with ERSA (the European Rotor Sports Association)
  we created an event that brings fans closer to the action of Drone Racing. \n\nMarrying
  the technologies of Qualcomm’s Snapdragon chip with EE 4Gee Action Cams over EE’s
  4G network at the world famous Wembley Stadium, selected industry journalists were
  invited to experience the race as if they themselves were the pilots."
