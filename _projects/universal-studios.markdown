description: Incentivising fans to smash the global box office record
brief: Drive box office sales and pre-bookings for Fast & Furious 8.
solution: We created a collection of 12 bespoke digital art products and rewarded fans who pre-booked at any cinema around the world on the first two weeks of theatrical release.
results: Smashed global box office record, previously held by Star Wars, and activated in 52 markets with 37 languages – the largest film promotion uptake in Universal’s history.
