At EARN, we believe in the importance of positive psychology and that through small changes in lifestyle, anyone can improve their happiness levels. These principles help to shape the way we work as a team. We wanted to put something out into the world that would help others feel the same.

The How’s Your Day app and book are designed in collaboration with leading positive psychology expert Bridget Grenville-Cleave. It help’s people track how happy and fulfilled they feel and receive tips on how to increase happiness levels.
