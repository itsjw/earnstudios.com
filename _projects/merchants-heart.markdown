description: A premium mixer range and magazine launched in just six months
brief: Create a cultural shift to catalyse creativity and innovation across Lucozade Ribena Suntory.
solution: Shifting the business away from its traditional two-year development cycles, we worked with LRS to invent and launch a range of premium mixers that could go to market within six months. We also launched Merchant’s Heart’s own magazine, KANPAI!, to celebrate and inspire the craft, culture and artistry of bartending and make Merchant’s Heart an essential part of drink culture.

results: Merchant’s Heart was launched in ten beta bars in London during December 2015 – just six months after our first conversation about the project, and this has now grown to over 100 bars across the UK. KANPA! is also stocked in over 300 bars, hotels, members clubs and offices in the UK.
