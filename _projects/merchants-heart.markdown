description: A premium mixer range and magazine launched in just six months
brief: Create a cultural shift to catalyse creativity and innovation across Lucozade
  Ribena Suntory.
solution: Shifting the business away from its traditional two-year development cycles,
  we worked with LRS to invent and launch a range of premium mixers that could go
  to market within six months. We also launched Merchant’s Heart’s own magazine, KANPAI!,
  to celebrate and inspire the craft, culture and artistry of bartending and make
  Merchant’s Heart an essential part of drink culture. Click here to browse of the
  magazine
results: Merchant’s Heart was launched in ten beta bars in London during December
  2015 – just six months after our first conversation about the project, and this
  has now grown to over 100 bars across the UK. KANPA! is also stocked in over 300
  bars, hotels, members clubs and offices in the UK.
