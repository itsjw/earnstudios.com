carousel-text: Creating a cultural shift… and a range of premium mixers
quote: EARN have helped transform our culture to live and breathe innovative thinking.
  We have happy people who are delivering great results
quote-cite: Peter Harding, CEO Lucozade Ribena Suntory
brief-text: 'We were tasked by Lucozade Ribena Suntory (LRS) to create a cultural
  shift that would catalyse creativity and innovation across the whole company.  Sounds
  easy, doesn’t it? '
solution-text: "It’s easy to talk about changing but it’s much harder to actually
  change. The only way you create change is through doing. \n\nWe saw an opportunity
  for the company to shift from its old ways of product development, i.e. two-year
  development cycles and traditional approaches to communications, to the new Suntory
  way of trailblazing innovation that shifts cultural expectations and habits.\n\nLRS
  needed to make the transition from talking about change to demonstrating change,
  so it was decided that the first manifestation of this would be to invent and launch
  a range of premium mixers that could go to market within six months. \n\nIn order
  for this project to launch within 6 months, and demonstrate a different approach
  to product and brand development, it had to sit outside the habitual LRS work streams
  and processes, whilst still tapping into some of the expertise in the company. "
results-text: "Merchant’s Heart was launched into 10 beta bars in London during December
  2015 – just six months after our first conversation about the project. \n\nDuring
  the Annual Global Suntory Research and Development Conference in Japan, Merchant’s
  Heart was voted as the most popular new product development of the year.  We credit
  its success to the collaborative approach taken in developing this product and the
  multidisciplinary team’s vision for how to bring it to market."
