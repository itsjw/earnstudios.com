description: A premium mixer range and magazine launched in just six months
brief: Launch LRS into the premium mixer category with style and agility.
solution: Shifting the business away from its traditional two-year development cycles,
  we worked with LRS to invent and launch a range of premium mixers within six months.
  To make Merchant’s Heart an essential part of drink culture we also launched it’s
  own magazine, KANPAI!, to celebrate and inspire the craft, culture and artistry
  of bartending. Click here to browse of the magazine
results: Merchant’s Heart was launched in ten beta bars in London during December
  2015 – just six months after our first conversation about the project, and this
  has now grown to over 100 bars across the UK. KANPA! is also stocked in over 300
  bars, hotels, members clubs and offices in the UK.
