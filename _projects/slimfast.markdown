  EARN Studios developed a modern version of the SlimFast Challenge. Building on the legacy and awareness of the original SlimFast Challenge, we developed the next generation version; one that is in line with the SlimFast brandâ€™s vision to modernise and drive reappraisal amongst consumers, whilst also winning new consumers.

  Our solution gave SlimFast an authentic reason to engage with consumers and provided a wealth of content, tools and assets to be activated across all of their channels (Twitter, Instagram, website, newsletters, PR, advertising and ambassadors.)
results-text: |-
  Over 20,000 registrations for the SlimFast Challenge via the newly created app.

  Over 1,000 active and vocal Facebook group members; helping to establish a community around the brand supporting each other and engaging with SlimFast.
