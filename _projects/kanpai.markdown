brief-text: To make Merchant’s Heart, a line of premium spirit enhancers, an essential
  part of drink culture
solution-text: "We created KANPAI! magazine as a brand property to sit independently
  alongside Merchant’s Heart. \n\nThe aim of KANPAI! is to celebrate and inspire the
  craft, culture and artistry of bartending.\n\nKANPAI! includes a series of unique
  features targeted at the drinks industry. You can find everything from a stylish
  photo-shoot with some of the biggest bartenders in London, to a comic strip on the
  carbonation of Merchant’s Heart, to a life shoot of cocktails as works of art, just
  to name a few."
results-text: "KANPAI! launched on April 18th with a party in Soho with over 180 attendees.
  \n\n\nAs the project is very new, come back soon for more results!"
