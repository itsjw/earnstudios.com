brief-text: To make Merchant’s Heart be more than just a product, to make it an essential
  part of drink culture
solution-text: "We created KANPAI! magazine as a brand property to sit independently
  alongside Merchant’s Heart. \n\nThe aim of the zine is to celebrate and inspire
  the craft, culture and artistry of bartending.\n\nThe zine includes a series of
  unique features targeted at the drinks industry. You can find everything from a
  stylish photo-shoot with some of the biggest bartenders in London, to a comic strip
  on the science of Merchant’s Heart, to a life shoot of cocktails as works of art,
  just to name a few."
results-text: "The zine successfully launched on April 18th with a huge party in Soho
  with over 180 attendees. \n\nAs the project is very new, come back soon for more
  results!"
